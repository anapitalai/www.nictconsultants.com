subtitle  : Napitalai ICT Consultants was registered in 2012 by Mr Alois Napitalai,a graduate Electronics Engineer from the PNG University of Technology and at that time was a Senior Technical Officer with Information and Communications Department. The main motive behind  the initiation of the business was the need for repairs of electronic items that were infiltrated into our country. There was the need for repair technicians and most importantly, the knowledge and qualifications they needed to strategically diagnose and repair electronic items hence he decided to run trainings and repair services. Since then, many services have been included like local area network and wireless designs and implementation,computer hardware and software installation and repairs and lately,the business has included web designs, programming and web hosting services. Web hosting is possible through computer virtualization where  the business has obtained a virtual private server from online and configured as a web server to host websites/applications. The websites or web application are  designed in such a way where user experience is our main focus. The sites are mobile friendly meaning adaptive and responsive. The sites are responsive to different screen resolutions and adapt when accessed from different screen sizes making mobile experience great.
